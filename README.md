- Clean and responsive UI across devices  
- RESTful API built using Node.js & Express  
- MongoDB database for persistent data  
- Authentication & authorization using JWT (or your method)  
- Modern front-end built with React

- **Responsive Design** – the UI adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile  
- **Role-based Access (if applicable)** – Admins can manage products and orders 
- **Modern Tech Stack**  
  - Frontend: React, optional state-management (Redux, Context API, etc)  
  - Backend: Node.js + Express  
  - Database: MongoDB (with Mongoose)  
  - Authentication: JWT 

---

## 🧰 Built With  
- **Frontend**: React.js, CSS, Tailwind
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database**: MongoDB (via Mongoose)  
- **Authentication & Security**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens), bcrypt
---

## 🔧 Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
- Node.js (v14+ recommended)  
- NPM 
- MongoDB instance (local or via Atlas)  
- Any required API keys or env variables  

### Setup Instructions  
Clone the repo:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saairam37/MERNprojectECW.git  
cd MERNprojectECW
````

#### Backend Setup (`/backend` folder)

1. Navigate into the backend folder:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file with environment variables, for example:

   ```env
   MONGO_URI=<your_mongo_connection_string>  
   JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>  
   NODE_ENV=development  
   ```
3. Install dependencies and start the server:

   ```bash
   npm install  
   npm run dev  
   ```

#### Frontend Setup (`/frontend` folder)

1. Navigate into the frontend folder:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. Adjust any `.env` or config files if needed (API endpoints, etc).
3. Install dependencies and start the front-end app:

   ```bash
   npm install  
   npm start  # or npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you configured) and explore the application.

## 📍 API Endpoints

Here’s a summary of the backend’s major endpoints (modify as per your actual implementation):

| Method | Endpoint           | Description                      | Protected |
| ------ | ------------------ | -------------------------------- | --------- |
| POST   | `/api/auth/signup` | Register a new user              | No        |

| GET    | `/api/auth/me`     | Get current logged-in user info  | Yes       |
| GET    | `/api/items`       | Retrieve list of items/resources | Yes       |
| POST   | `/api/items`       | Create new item                  | Yes       |

## 🧠 Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for the next version:

* Add **real-time features** (e.g., WebSockets / Socket.io)
* Role-based access (e.g., user vs admin)
* Integrate **third-party APIs** for extended functionalities
* Add **unit & integration tests** (Jest, Mocha, Cypress)
* Improve deployment (CI/CD pipeline, Docker, Kubernetes)
* Mobile responsiveness / PWA support
* Optimize performance (caching, lazy loading, code splitting)
